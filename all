jcubeexplorer - This is a wrapper for Kociemba's excellent cube explorer java library
lib	- The library folder you requested I put everything in
middle - "middleware", for lack of a better word. It's code that will connect the clients to the servers we will write (for now, there is just the scramble server)
servers - Servers! For now, this is just the ScrambleServer

./lib:
commons-lang-2.5.jar - This has a number of useful string utilities, specifically StringUtils.join()
fatjar.jar - This is an awesome ant build task that creates a single "fat" jar from source code and numerous jar libraries.
gson-1.4.jar - Java json library
jopt-simple-3.2.jar - Java command line options parser
libraries - text file keeping track of all the active libraries

./middle:
java - This directory contains the start of the java library that will connect clients to the servers

./servers:
scrambleserver

./servers/scrambleserver:
build.xml
jstest - This is just a proof of concept html directory that generates scrambles using the ScrambleServer
src

./servers/scrambleserver/src:
com
net
scramblers

These all need to be updated to be prettier given the more simple api.
./servers/scrambleserver/src/scramblers:
ClockScrambler.java
CubeScrambler.java
MegaminxScrambler.java
