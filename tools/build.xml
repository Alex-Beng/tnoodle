		This project contains scripts that are run when certain git commands are executed.
		Right now, the only git command we're hooking into is "git commit". I've commited code that fails jslint too many times now, and this should prevent it.

		For these scripts to actually *do* anything, they must be in the .git/git-hooks directory. I recommend soft linking them there, so you won't have to keep 2 files in sync:
			ln -s ../../git-hooks/pre-commit pre-commit
