Scramble = Scramble
Round = Round
of = of
Attempt = Attempt
Competitor = Competitor
Warning = DO NOT FILL IF YOU ARE THE COMPETITOR.
Event = Fewest Moves
Graded = Graded by
Result = Result

rule1 = Notate your solution by writing one move per bar.
rule2 = To delete moves, clearly erase or blacken them.
rule3 = Face moves F, B, R, L, U, and D are clockwise.
rule4 = Rotations x, y, and z follow R, U, and F.
rule5 = ' inverts a move; 2 doubles a move. (e.g.: U', U2)
rule6 = w makes a face move into two layers. (e.g.: Uw)
rule7 = A [lowercase] move is a cube rotation. (e.g.: [u])
rule8 = You have 1 hour to find a solution.
rule9 = Your solution length will be counted in OBTM.
rule10 = Your solution must be at most %s moves, including rotations.
rule11 = Your solution must not be directly derived from any part of the scrambling algorithm.

Warning2 = Please see separate sheet for scrambles.
