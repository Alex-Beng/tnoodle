Tnoodle is really a collection of 4 projects.

* jcubeexplorer: A wrapper for Herbert Kociemba's excellent Java implementation of the 2-phase algorithm to save its tables to disk. This shaves the ~10 seconds normally spent starting up down to a fraction of a second. The original source is available here: http://kociemba.org/cube.htm

* tnoodlescrambles: A Java scrambling suite. Java applications can use this project as a library, a perfect example of this is tnoodleserver.

* tnoodleserver: A webserver that serves up scrambles, scramble images, and tnoodletimer.

* tnoodlestackmat: A Java library that parses a Stackmat plugged into an audio port.

* tnoodletimer: A Javascript Rubik's Cube timer.

* tnoodleutils: Useful Java functions.

Dependency graph (it would be really cool to automate the generation of this):
